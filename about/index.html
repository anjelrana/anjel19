                        Since childhood, when I was around 8-9 year, I got a sense of competing and giving my best to any task
                       that I work on. And having such kind of value set in the early age is quite fruitful for the after rest 
                        of the life. All thanks to my fond towards sport.

                        At first, I chose the hockey and realised that this isn't for me i.e our national sports.And again went 
                        after the most popular game in the country, Cricket. I used to jump over the walls and even the fences of 
                        the school during the weekend just to play the Cricket with my friends. But at last the one of the precious 
                        thing, I consider in my life was found that was football. I started watching the freestyle first which 
                        attract me toward the football. Back in the early days,
