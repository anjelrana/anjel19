                        Since childhood, when I was around 8-9 year, I got a sense of competing and giving my best to any task
                       that I work on. And having such kind of value set in the early age is quite fruitful for the after rest 
                        of the life. All thanks to my fond towards sport.

                        At first, I chose the hockey and realised that this isn't for me i.e our national sports.And again went 
                        after the most popular game in the country, Cricket. I used to jump over the walls and even the fences of 
                        the school during the weekend just to play the Cricket with my friends. But at last the one of the precious 
                        thing, I consider in my life was found that was football. I started watching the freestyle first which 
                        attract me toward the football. Back in the early days around the 13-14 age, I was dreaming of becoming 
                        the best player in the world. So naive was I back in the days. But all that training, late night exercise and 
                        early morning jogging shaped my discipline and helped me thinking straight and work under the pressure.
                        Those failure in trials and selection for the academy taught that make more mistake world does not char
                        about your failue.
                        But again the football was not my thing. Doing a lot of introspection, I got to know about that I have a 
                        kind of attraction towards the learning and building business and product.
                        I still do not know where I might end up in the future but at least that I know that I am working on 
                        a plan which focuses on learning and execution based on putting myself out of comfort zone
